# What's this?
This is a m3u8 playlist file for Unifi playTV / Unifi TV. These links don't use normal HLS / MPEG-TS Livestreams, instead, using encrypted ones (MPEG-DASH). Remember, this guide is not used to bypass DRM and doesn't provide Free Links - you need your own unifi TV subscription.  
  
Note that this is also another way to watch Unifi TV through TiviMate through Telekom Malaysia's official servers. It is not required to install the official Unifi TV app.

# Tested on what device / app?
Works well on Tivimate v2.8.0 and TVirl (Xiaomi Mi Box S).
## What Internet Connection?
Tested on Unifi Air. It will play on multiple resolutions according to the Internet speed (ranging from 576p to 1080p). Unifi Fibre Broadband might get better speeds when playing.

# Do you have some of the screenshots for these channels?

# Other special stuffs?
